# HSCASpring2023

This repository has elements for the Spring 2023 High-Speed Computer Arithmetic Class. It has the project files for the binary32 754-compliant fpdiv design in SystemVerilog.

Note: Please build the TestFloat/SoftFloat libraries before you begin. You can use the scripts build_me.sh to build things in the addins subdirectory. I have clean_me.sh in the repository if you want to delete items as it does create a large repository (e.g., if you wanted to have your own forked repository).

You will need gcc to compile the programs and I would recommend using Mac or Linux for this.  However, if you have Windows you can still do this with cygwin.  There may be better options, but this is a good start.
